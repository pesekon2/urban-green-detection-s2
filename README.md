## Title

Convolutional Neural Networks for Urban Green Areas Segmentation on Sentinel-2
Data

## Description

Source code used for paper Convolutional Neural Networks for Urban Green Areas
Segmentation on Sentinel-2 Data. The repozitory is frozen since October 2023 at
the state corresponding to the paper. It is a fork of
<https://github.com/ctu-geoforall-lab-projects/phd-pesek-2022> but due to
the fact that you cannot make two forks of one repository under the same user,
I had to go for the "new repository" way. Only files important for the paper
were kept in this "fork".
